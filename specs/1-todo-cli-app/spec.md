# Feature Specification: Evolution of Todo – Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App

**Feature Branch**: `1-todo-cli-app`
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Evolution of Todo – Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App Target audience: Product architects and developers learning spec-driven, AI-agent-powered development Focus: Build a fully functional command-line Todo application using only AI-generated code driven by clear specifications, with zero manual coding Success criteria: - Application demonstrates all 5 Basic Level features interactively: Add Task, View Task List, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark as Complete - User can add tasks with title and description, list tasks with clear status indicators (e.g., [ ] or [x]), toggle completion, update details, and delete by ID - All functionality works correctly in a single session with in-memory storage - Code passes static type checking (mypy --strict) with zero errors - Every implemented feature is directly traceable to a committed specification file in /specs/history - Project runs cleanly with UV and Python 3.13+ Constraints: - Storage: In-memory only (no file, database, or external persistence in Phase I) - Interface: Text-based console CLI only (no GUI, web, or TUI libraries like Rich/Curses in core logic) - Dependencies: Standard library + minimal third-party only if required for project tooling (e.g., UV); no external frameworks - Tasks must include at minimum: unique ID, title, description, completion status (boolean) - All code must be generated by AI agent (currently Qwen Code CLI, transitioning to Claude Code) based on specifications - Project must follow standard Python structure: /src package with modules, separate CLI entrypoint Not building: - Persistence to disk, database, or cloud storage - Intermediate Level features (priorities, tags, search, filter, sort) - User authentication or multi-user support - Graphical or web interface - Automated tests (will be added in later phases) - Advanced CLI styling beyond basic print/input (e.g., no colored output or tables in Phase I core)"

## Constitution Compliance Check

This specification adheres to the Evolution of Todo Constitution by:
- Following the spec-driven development principle (all implementation will follow this specification)
- Ensuring all code will be AI-generated based on this specification
- Maintaining clean architecture and progressive complexity
- Including type hints, docstrings, and PEP 8 compliance requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add and View Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add tasks to my todo list and view them so that I can keep track of what I need to do.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of a todo application - users need to be able to add tasks and see them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task and then listing all tasks to verify it appears in the list with the correct details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am using the todo application, **When** I add a new task with a title and description, **Then** the task appears in my task list with a unique ID and "incomplete" status indicator
2. **Given** I have added multiple tasks, **When** I view the task list, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their ID, title, description, and completion status

---

### User Story 2 - Update and Mark Complete Tasks (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to update my tasks and mark them as complete so that I can track my progress and modify task details as needed.

**Why this priority**: After adding tasks, users need to be able to manage them by updating details and marking completion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task, updating its details, and marking it as complete to verify the status changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task in my list, **When** I update the task details, **Then** the task reflects the new information when viewed
2. **Given** I have an incomplete task, **When** I mark it as complete, **Then** the task shows a completed status indicator

---

### User Story 3 - Delete Tasks (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to delete tasks from my list so that I can remove items that are no longer relevant.

**Why this priority**: Users need to be able to remove tasks that are no longer needed, completing the basic CRUD operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task and then deleting it to verify it no longer appears in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task in my list, **When** I delete the task, **Then** the task no longer appears in the task list

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to update or delete a task that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle empty or very long task titles/descriptions?
- What happens when all tasks are deleted - does the system handle an empty list gracefully?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add tasks with a unique ID, title, description, and completion status
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all tasks with clear status indicators (e.g., [ ] for incomplete, [x] for complete)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to update task details (title, description) by ID
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to mark tasks as complete/incomplete by ID
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to delete tasks by ID
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain all tasks in memory during a single session
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a command-line interface for all operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST assign sequential unique IDs to tasks automatically

### Code Quality Requirements (from Constitution)

- All code MUST include type hints for functions, classes, and variables
- All code MUST follow PEP 8 style guidelines and be formatted with Ruff or Black
- Every public function and class MUST have docstrings (Google or NumPy style)
- Implementation MUST use UV for dependency management

### Key Entities

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item with attributes: unique ID (integer), title (string), description (string), completion status (boolean)
- **TaskList**: Collection of Task entities with operations to add, view, update, delete, and mark complete

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: User can add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete interactively in the console
- **SC-002**: All 5 Basic Level features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete) work correctly in a single session
- **SC-003**: Task list displays with clear status indicators and all task details
- **SC-004**: Application runs without errors and handles invalid inputs gracefully

### Constitution Compliance Metrics

- All specifications MUST be stored in the /specs/history folder with descriptive filenames and version timestamps
- All generated code MUST be traceable to its originating specification
- Implementation MUST demonstrate all Basic Level features: Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete
- All code MUST pass mypy with zero errors
- Specifications MUST cover 100% of implemented functionality
