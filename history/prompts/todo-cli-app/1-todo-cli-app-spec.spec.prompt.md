  /sp.specify Evolution of Todo – Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App Target audience: Product architects and developers learning spec-driven, AI-agent-powered development Focus: Build a fully functional command-line Todo application using only AI-generated code driven by clear specifications, with zero manual coding Success criteria: - Application demonstrates all 5 Basic Level features interactively: Add Task, View Task List, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark as Complete - User can add tasks with title and description, list tasks with clear status indicators (e.g., [ ] or [x]), toggle completion, update details, and delete by ID - All functionality works correctly in a single session with in-memory storage - Code passes static type checking (mypy --strict) with zero errors - Every implemented feature is directly traceable to a committed specification file in /specs/history - Project runs cleanly with UV and Python 3.13+ Constraints: - Storage: In-memory only (no file, database, or external persistence in Phase I) - Interface: Text-based console CLI only (no GUI, web, or TUI libraries like Rich/Curses in core logic) - Dependencies: Standard library + minimal third-party only if required for project tooling (e.g., UV); no external frameworks - Tasks must include at minimum: unique ID, title, description, completion status (boolean) - All code must be generated by AI agent (currently Qwen Code CLI, transitioning to Claude Code) based on specifications - Project must follow standard Python structure: /src package with modules, separate CLI entrypoint Not building: - Persistence to disk, database, or cloud storage - Intermediate Level features (priorities, tags, search, filter, sort) - User authentication or multi-user support - Graphical or web interface - Automated tests (will be added in later phases) - Advanced CLI styling beyond basic print/input (e.g., no colored output or tables in Phase I core)
response_text: |
  Created a comprehensive feature specification for the Evolution of Todo CLI application. The specification includes:
  - User stories for adding/viewing tasks (P1), updating/marking complete (P2), and deleting tasks (P3)
  - Functional requirements covering all 5 basic features: Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete
  - Success criteria with measurable outcomes
  - Edge cases to consider
  - Constitution compliance checks
  - A quality checklist that validates all requirements are met
outcome: |
  Successfully created a complete feature specification that adheres to the project constitution and covers all required functionality for the Phase I todo CLI application. The spec is ready for the planning phase.
evaluation: |
  The specification comprehensively covers all 5 Basic Level features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete) as required. It follows the constitution principles with proper user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria. The quality checklist confirms all requirements are met and no clarifications are needed.
