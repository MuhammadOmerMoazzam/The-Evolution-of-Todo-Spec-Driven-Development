  /sp.constitution Project: Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI

  Core principles:
  - Spec-driven development: Every feature starts with a clear, verifiable specification before any implementation
  - No manual coding: All code must be generated by AI agents (currently Qwen Code CLI, transitioning to Claude Code) based on specifications
  - Progressive complexity: Build incrementally from in-memory CLI to distributed cloud-native AI systems while maintaining full functionality at each phase
  - Clean architecture: Modular, readable, and maintainable code following Python best practices
  - Quality through automation: Rely on specifications to enforce consistency, testability, and reproducibility

  Key standards:
  - All specifications must be stored in the /specs/history folder with descriptive filenames and version timestamps
  - Code must use **type hints** for all functions, classes, and variables
  - Code must follow **PEP 8** style guidelines and be formatted with Ruff or Black
  - Every public function and class must have **docstrings** (Google or NumPy style)
  - Project structure must follow standard Python layout (/src package, separate entrypoint)
  - Use **UV** for dependency management and virtual environments
  - All generated code must be traceable to its originating specification

  Constraints:
  - Phase I limited to in-memory storage (no persistence to disk or database)
  - Only standard library or minimal dependencies allowed in early phases
  - Console interface must be intuitive and text-based (no GUI in Phase I)
  - Tasks must include at minimum: ID, title, description, status (complete/incomplete)
  - Implementation must demonstrate all Basic Level features: Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete

  Success criteria:
  - Application runs without errors and demonstrates all 5 Basic Level features interactively
  - All code is fully type-annotated with mypy passing with zero errors
  - Specifications cover 100% of implemented functionality and are committed to git
  - README.md includes clear setup and usage instructions
  - CLAUDE.md (or equivalent) documents the AI agent prompts and workflow used
  - Clean git history with constitution committed first, followed by specs and implementations
response_text: |
  Created and updated the project constitution file with the specified principles, standards, constraints, and success criteria. Updated all related templates (spec, plan, tasks) to align with the constitution. Created README.md and CLAUDE.md files as required. Set up the initial project structure following Python best practices and constitution standards. Created pyproject.toml with appropriate configuration for type checking, formatting, and dependencies.
outcome: |
  Successfully created the project constitution and aligned all relevant templates and documentation to follow the specified principles. The project is now properly set up with the required structure and documentation to follow spec-driven development practices.
evaluation: |
  The constitution has been properly implemented with all required elements included. All related templates have been updated to reflect the new principles. The project structure follows Python best practices and constitution standards. All required files (README.md, CLAUDE.md) have been created as specified.
