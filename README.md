# Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI

This project demonstrates the evolution of a simple todo application from an in-memory CLI tool to a distributed cloud-native AI system, following spec-driven development principles.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- UV package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Evolution-of-Todo-Spec-Driven-Development.git
   cd Evolution-of-Todo-Spec-Driven-Development
   ```

2. Install dependencies using UV:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install the project in development mode:
   ```bash
   uv build
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

### Running the CLI Application

```bash
# Run the todo application
python -m src.todo
```

### Available Commands (via menu interface)

- `1. Add Task` - Add a new task with title and description
- `2. View Tasks` - List all tasks with their status indicators
- `3. Update Task` - Modify an existing task's title or description
- `4. Delete Task` - Remove a task from the list
- `5. Mark Task Complete/Incomplete` - Toggle the completion status of a task
- `6. Exit` - Quit the application

## Development

### Code Quality Standards

This project follows the following standards as defined in the constitution:

- All code includes type hints for functions, classes, and variables
- All code follows PEP 8 style guidelines and is formatted with Ruff or Black
- Every public function and class has docstrings (Google or NumPy style)
- Implementation uses UV for dependency management
- All specifications are stored in the /specs/history folder

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run unit tests only
python -m pytest tests/unit/

# Run integration tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Run mypy for type checking
python -m mypy src/
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format code with Black
python -m black src/

# Check PEP 8 compliance with Ruff
python -m ruff check src/
```

## Contributing

This project follows a spec-driven development approach where every feature starts with a clear, verifiable specification before any implementation. All code is generated by AI agents based on these specifications.

1. Create a new specification in the `specs/` directory
2. Generate implementation tasks based on the specification
3. Implement features following the tasks
4. Submit a pull request with both the specification and implementation
