# Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
Every feature starts with a clear, verifiable specification before any implementation. This ensures that all development is purposeful, testable, and aligned with project goals.

### No Manual Coding
All code must be generated by AI agents (currently Qwen Code CLI, transitioning to Claude Code) based on specifications. This enforces consistency, reduces human error, and ensures all code is traceable to its originating specification.

### Progressive Complexity
Build incrementally from in-memory CLI to distributed cloud-native AI systems while maintaining full functionality at each phase. Each phase must be complete and functional before advancing to the next.

### Clean Architecture
Modular, readable, and maintainable code following Python best practices. Code structure must be intuitive and follow established patterns for long-term maintainability.

### Quality Through Automation
Rely on specifications to enforce consistency, testability, and reproducibility. Automated testing and validation ensure high-quality deliverables at every stage.

## Key Standards

- All specifications must be stored in the /specs/history folder with descriptive filenames and version timestamps
- Code must use **type hints** for all functions, classes, and variables
- Code must follow **PEP 8** style guidelines and be formatted with Ruff or Black
- Every public function and class must have **docstrings** (Google or NumPy style)
- Project structure must follow standard Python layout (/src package, separate entrypoint)
- Use **UV** for dependency management and virtual environments
- All generated code must be traceable to its originating specification

## Constraints

- Phase I limited to in-memory storage (no persistence to disk or database)
- Only standard library or minimal dependencies allowed in early phases
- Console interface must be intuitive and text-based (no GUI in Phase I)
- Tasks must include at minimum: ID, title, description, status (complete/incomplete)
- Implementation must demonstrate all Basic Level features: Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete

## Success Criteria

- Application runs without errors and demonstrates all 5 Basic Level features interactively
- All code is fully type-annotated with mypy passing with zero errors
- Specifications cover 100% of implemented functionality and are committed to git
- README.md includes clear setup and usage instructions
- CLAUDE.md (or equivalent) documents the AI agent prompts and workflow used
- Clean git history with constitution committed first, followed by specs and implementations

## Governance

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and practices that govern the Evolution of Todo project. All development activities must align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation of the change, its rationale, and approval from project maintainers. All team members are responsible for ensuring compliance with these principles during development, review, and testing processes.
